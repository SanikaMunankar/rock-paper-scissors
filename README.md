# Rock Paper Scissors 🎮

## 📌 Project Description
This is a simple interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game that I built using **HTML** and **JavaScript**.  
In this project, I created a game where the player competes against the computer by choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

## 🎯 Purpose
I created this project to practice and improve my web development skills, especially in JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and handling user interactions.  
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of building small interactive browser-based games.

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Select one of the three options: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.  
2. The computer will automatically make a random choice.  
3. The winner of each round is based on:
   - **Rock** beats **Scissors**
   - **Paper** beats **Rock**
   - **Scissors** beats **Paper**
4. The game consists of **5 rounds**.
5. After all rounds are complete, the scores are compared.
6. The player with the **higher score** (You or the Computer) wins the game.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** – for the game structure  
- **JavaScript** – for game logic and interactivity
